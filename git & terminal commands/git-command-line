Git Command Line- sub branch check.

1. git commit - add changes and message. 
2. git stagging- select individual file or partial file for commits. 
3. git add file-name
4. git diff file-name: shows what has changed.
5. git status. 
6. git log: helps to check the commits made. 
7. git branching. 

A Written Convention:
i.  Highly depends on teams and projects.


Integrating Changes & Structuring Releases: 
i.  Mainline Development- "Always Be Integrating"
-   single branch where everyone commits their work.
-   very few branches. 
-   commits are relatively small due to constant integration model. 
-   must have high quality testing and QA standard is top notch. 

ii. State, Release, and Feature Branches
-   different types of branches. 
-   fulfill different types of jobs. 

Long-Running Branches- Main or Master Branch | Develop Branch so on. 
- exist through the complete lifetime of the project. 
- no direct commits, it should be done through merge or rebase to make sure the code is reviewed and test. 

Short-Lived Branches: Feature branch
- usually done for new features, bug fixes, refactorings, experiments. 
- will be deleted after integrations- merge. (merge/rebase)

Note: Branching Strategies depends on "Team | Projects" etc. 


Pull Requests
- invites reviewers to provide feedback before merging.
- contribute code to other repositories where one doesn't have access to merge such as open source project.

Merge Conflicts
- occurs when a version of a file has been submitted that is newer than the version of the file you have stated to base your changes on. 
- easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes.
